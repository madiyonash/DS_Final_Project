# Introduction


# *Tidying* Up the Data

Since the data initially came from all years that I have used the app, it is important to make the data tidy and easier to work with.

Load necessary packages: 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

Import data:
```{r}
clean_report <- read.csv()
```


```{r}
#read data from file 
```
