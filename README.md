**Summary**

I use a daily journaling app called "Daylio" to track my mood and activities that I have done throughout the day. In 2019, I made the accomplishment of tracking this every single day of the year (with some days having multiple entries). This made me wonder, how has my mood changed over time and if there are any factors that may influence it. This project involves exploratory data analysis using this dataset.
